$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 5x_2 = 7 \\
-2x_1 + -7x_2 = -5
\end{cases}
$$

Since the coefficient of the first variable is 1, we don't need to do any substitution. Now, we need to do the proper math.

Proceed with the operation $①\times2②→②$.    

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 5x_2 = 7 \\
~~~~~~~~3x_2 = 9
\end{cases}
$$

Comparing the above expression to the one below, we can see that the variable is directly available, so we just need to perform a real multiple operation.

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 5x_2 = 7 \\
~~~~~~~~~~x_2 = 3
\end{cases}
$$ 

$① + ② \times(-5) → ①$

If you do the math, you should end up with a calculation like this

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 = -8 \\
x_2 = 3
\end{cases}
$$ 

You should be able to get it in one of the following ways
